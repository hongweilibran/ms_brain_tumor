This is a tutorial about the publicly multi-parametric MRI dataset for multi-source brain tumor characterization.

### Data format
Each patient in each tumor category has the same naming format, such as  

  001-Glioma-AYEY

        |  flair.nii.gz

        |  t1.nii.gz

        |  t2.nii.gz

        |  t1ce.nii.gz

        |  flair_seg.nii.gz
   
In this case, *001* is the patient number, *Glioma* is the tumor category, and *AYEY* is the center ID.
